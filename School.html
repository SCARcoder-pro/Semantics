                <p>
                    St. Xaviers School, Godavari is a school under the management of the Nepal Jesuit Society. Nepal
                    Jesuit Society is the
                    Nepal branch of the Society of Jesus, an international Catholic Religious Order. The Society of
                    Jesus was founded in
                    Europe by St. Ignatius of Loyola in 1540. Members of the Society of Jesus popularly known as the
                    Jesuits, have been
                    active in the field of education and other fields of service worldwide since its origin.

                    St. Xaviers Godavari is the first Jesuit school established in Nepal. In 1950 The Government of
                    Nepal invited Fr. Moran
                    a Jesuit priest serving in India to start a school in Kathmandu valley. On July 1, 1951 Fr. Moran
                    and two other Jesuits
                    Fr. Murphy and Fr. Saxton, started St. Xaviers School, Godavari with 65 students. They named the
                    school after St.
                    Francis Xavier one of the 9 companions of St. Ignatius and the first Jesuit to serve on Asian soil.
                    The school is one of
                    hundreds of educational institutions throughout the world managed by the Jesuits. Worldwide the
                    Jesuits are now
                    responsible for:

                    231 Higher Educational Institutions (Universities, University Residences, Colleges and Philosophy/
                    Theology Colleges)

                <h2>OUR GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</h2>
                <p>
                    Our educational apostolate aims at accompanying persons to achieve fullness in life and integral
                    development. Our
                    education enables students to become effective agents of social change, and persons with and for
                    others. A successful
                    Xavierian is one who has distinguished himself/herself in the service of others. The school strives
                    to achieve academic
                    excellence as well as social excellence. Our aim is to provide an education that prepares students
                    to live a meaningful
                    life as well as one that will unite and equalize social and economic groups in society.

                    In keeping with the purpose of Jesuit education, St. Xaviers School strives towards the following
                    objectives:

                    a. Spiritual and moral objectives: The students shall show tolerance for the religious conviction of
                    others and respect
                    the rights and dignity of others.

                    b. Intellectual objectives: The students shall systematically develop their powers of observation,
                    imagination,
                    thinking, reasoning, understanding, communicating, interacting, affirming habits, attitudes and
                    values.

                    c. Social and civic objectives: The students shall acquire knowledge and appreciation of Nepali
                    culture and shall become
                    active agents of change for the purpose of bringing about a better and just society.

                    d. Aesthetic objectives: The students shall develop an appreciation for the beauty of God reflected
                    in the Universe
                    through arts and other means of creative expression that enrich the quality of human life.

                    e. Physical and mental health objectives: The student shall develop physical fitness, emotional
                    health, maturity and a
                    wholesome personality.

                    In academics, the school follows the curriculum prescribed by the Education Department of the
                    Government of Nepal. The
                    school focuses on programmes and activities which will help the students to grow in different areas;
                    physical,
                    intellectual, spiritual and psychological. Thus, games are compulsory at SXG, and other
                    extracurricular activities are
                    highly emphasized. Even though both English and Nepali are taught here and emphasized, the language
                    of the school is
                    ENGLISH. The school rule for students is to speak good/correct English at all times inside the
                    school compound, in the
                    bus and at school bus stops. During class time, answers and comments made by students should be
                    given in complete,
                    correctly phrased English sentences. Value education for the non-Christians and catechism for the
                    Christians is
                    compulsory in the school.

                    The years the students spend in the school should enable them to acquire sound principles of conduct
                    and action as well
                    as lay a solid foundation of true and purposeful living when they attain adulthood. Principles of
                    honesty, trust,
                    cooperation, self-reliance, and hard work are inculcated through various activities. In these
                    activities students learn
                    to think for themselves under the steady supervision of moderators. With activities, students are
                    given the opportunity
                    to see practical applications of abstract ideas like give and take that they learn in the classroom.
