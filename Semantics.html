                <h2>Facts About Laptop</h2>
                <p>
                    Laptops have many advantages over desktop computers. Laptops' portability and battery make
                    productivity possible nearly
                    anywhere, especially as almost all laptops possess Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and the ability to connect to
                    cellular networks.
                    Laptops are also far more power efficient than desktop computers.

                    Other major technology companies entered the market in the 1980s, each releasing a new experiment.
                    In 1983 Radio Shack
                    brought the Japanese TRS-80 Model 100 to the United States; it was one of the first computers with a
                    liquid crystal
                    display (LCD). Commodore followed in 1984 with its 9.1-kilogram (20-pound) Commodore SX-64, the
                    first portable computer
                    to offer colour. The Gavilan SC debuted that year as well, notable for being the first computer
                    marketed as a “laptop.”
                    In 1986 IBM released the PC Convertible, the first laptop to weigh less than 6.8 kilograms (15
                    pounds). Other historic
                    releases included 1988’s Compaq SLT/286, the first battery-powered laptop with VGA graphics and an
                    internal hard drive,
                    and 1989’s NEC Ultra-Lite, the first notebook-style (lightweight) laptop.
